Red Line MBTA Simulation:

Overview:
This project simulates the Red Line of the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority). The simulation involves populating stations with trains and passengers from text files, running the simulation, and logging the status
of the railway stations and the movement of trains and passengers.

Project Structure:
The provided project contains the following files:

Data Structure Classes:
Node.java: A class representing a node in a linked list.
Queue.java: A class implementing a queue using a linked list.
DoubleLinkedList.java: A class implementing a doubly linked list.

MBTA Related Classes:
Rider.java: A class representing a rider (passenger) in the MBTA system.
Train.java: A class representing a train in the MBTA system.
Station.java: A class representing a station in the MBTA system.
Railway.java: A class managing the overall railway system, including stations and trains.
MBTA.java: The main class runs the simulation and handles the interaction between trains, stations, and riders.

JUnit Test Files:
QueueTest.java: A file where I write tests for my implementation of the Queue class.
DoubleLinkedListTest.java: A file where I write tests for my implementation of the DoubleLinkedList class.
RiderTest.java: Provided JUnit tests for the Rider class.
TrainTest.java: Provided JUnit tests for the Train class.
StationTest.java: Provided JUnit tests for the Station class.
